In this activity, I'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills 
I learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete 
stock from the store's inventory.


I have connected successfully to MySQL by getting a successful connection id 
and then we are given a list of available products to select and shop from. 
Each item has an id, the name of what the item is, the department the item 
is categorized under, the price of an individual unit of the item, as well 
as how many items are currently in stock at the time. 
The user is prompted to input the id of the item they wish to buy.

After getting the user's input, the program then adjust the units by the number the user
has requested if there are enough units to fulfill their request.
